## My process

### Built with

- Typescript
- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### What I learned

This is my first real project with SvelteKit, so I am glad to have learned a lot from this technology.

### Continued development

I am still not comfortable or fast enough with Svelte yet, despite finding it to be extremely fast to write and easy to understand. I want to produce more projects with SvelteKit to practice my knowledge of it. Perhaps exploring more thoroughly and try out endpoints, API routes.

Also, I want to improve my TailwindCSS skill further!
